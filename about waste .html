        <section id="about" style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <h2 style="font-weight: 700; font-size: xx-large; margin-left: 10px; text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">About Waste Segregation</h2>
            <img style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;" src="aw p2.jpg" alt="About Waste Segregation">
            <p style="font-size: large; margin-bottom: 20px;">Waste segregation is the process of separating waste into different categories to facilitate proper disposal and recycling.It involves separating waste into distinct categories such as wet, dry, sanitary, and electronic waste, enabling effective recycling, treatment, and disposal. One of the primary benefits of waste segregation is its positive impact on the environment. When waste is mixed and dumped into landfills it further leads to the release of harmful chemicals and greenhouse gases, 
                which contribute to pollution and climate change.
            <p style="font-size: large; margin-bottom: 20px;">The importance of waste segregation cannot be overstated. When waste is not segregated, it often ends up in landfills where it releases harmful gases like methane and carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming. 
                Proper segregation also ensures that harmful substances like electronic waste (e-waste) or medical waste are disposed of safely without posing health risks to humans or animals. Additionally, recycling segregated waste reduces the demand for new raw materials, conserving natural resources such as wood, metal, and oil.

            <div class="types-grid">
                <!-- Wet Waste -->
                <div>
                    <img style="margin-top: 30px;" src="aw p3.jpg"  alt="Wet Waste">
                    <h3>Wet Waste</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: medium; margin-top: 20px;">
                        Wet waste includes organic materials that decompose, such as food scraps, vegetable peels, fruit waste, and garden trimmings. This type of waste can be composted to create nutrient-rich fertilizer for plants.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Dry Waste -->
                <div>
                    <img style="margin-top: 30px;" src="aw p6.jpg"  alt="Dry Waste">
                    <h3>Dry Waste</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: medium;margin-top: 20px;">
                        Dry waste includes recyclable materials such as paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and metals. Properly segregating dry waste ensures it can be processed and reused, reducing landfill contributions.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: medium;margin-top: 20px;">
                        Sanitary waste consists of items like diapers, sanitary napkins, and medical waste that require special disposal methods to ensure public health and safety.

                    <p style="font-size: medium;margin-top: 20px;">
                        E-waste includes electronic items such as old phones, computers, and batteries. These items should be disposed of at designated e-waste collection centers to prevent environmental damage caused by hazardous materials.

        <!-- Why It Matters -->
        <section id="importance">
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: xx-large;font-weight: 700;">Why Waste Segregation Matters</h2>
            <img style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 30px;" src="aw p7.jpg" alt="Why It Matters">
            <p style="font-size: large; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">
                Proper waste segregation has far-reaching benefits for the environment, economy, and public health:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Waste segregation plays a crucial role in protecting the environment by reducing landfill waste, preventing pollution, and conserving natural resources. This helps minimize methane emissionsâ€”a potent greenhouse gas produced by decomposing organic matter in landfills. By ensuring that recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, and metal are separated, segregation conserves raw materials, reduces energy consumption, and supports a circular economy, promoting long-term sustainability.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Promotes Recycling:</strong> Proper waste segregation ensures that recyclable materials remain uncontaminated, making the recycling process more efficient and effective. When materials like glass, plastic, and paper are mixed with organic or hazardous waste, they often become unusable for recycling, leading to increased landfill waste. By segregating waste at the source, households, businesses, and industries can support recycling initiatives and reduce the demand for virgin resources. </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Improves Public Health:</strong> Segregating waste minimizes exposure to harmful substances and reduces the spread of diseases, thus improving public health. Hazardous waste, such as medical and electronic waste, contains toxic components that can cause serious health issues if not disposed of properly.Furthermore, segregated waste management practices reduce the accumulation of garbage in open areas, which can attract pests and lead to the spread of diseases like malaria, dengue, and cholera.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong>Cuts costs and saves resources by sorting waste at the source.
                    Generates revenue through recyclables and reduces landfill expenses with composting.
                    Promotes sustainability while minimizing waste and increasing recycling. </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Steps to Get Started -->
        <section id="steps">
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: xx-large;font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 7px;">Steps to Adopt Waste Segregation</h2>
            <ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
                <li style="margin: 5px;"><strong>Set Up Separate Bins:</strong> Use distinct bins for wet waste, dry waste, sanitary waste, and e-waste.</li>
                <li style="margin: 5px;"><strong>Educate Your Household:</strong> Teach everyone in your home about proper waste segregation practices.</li>
                <li style="margin: 5px;"><strong>Dispose Responsibly:</strong> Use community collection points or services for hazardous and recyclable waste.</li>
                <li style="margin: 5px;"><strong>Compost Organic Waste:</strong> Create a compost pile or use a compost bin for kitchen and garden waste.</li>
